Microsoft Excel is the tool used through out this project right from getting the data, cleaning and analysis.

## Data cleaning
1. I reviewed the data type of the fields in the data set and changed them appropriately.
2. I created new fields like days of the week, month, year and hour of day using excel functions.
3. Handled missing values.

### Data manipulation
Using excel functions to get the year, month name..
```excel function
YEAR(collision date)
```
```
MONTHNAME(collision date)
```
```
DAYNAME(collision date)
```
```
HOUR(collision date)
```

## Analysis
1. Comparing the rate of collision per month

Accidents frequency increased in the first three month of the years. Highest number of accidents occur in March followed by January.

4. Most contributing factor to the reported accidents and fatal accident specifically.

The factors contributing to the accidents were not Specified for 30% of accidents. Driver Inattention/Distraction accounted for 29%.


### Recommendation

1. Consider adding age as part of the accident report to determine if distracted drivers fall into a certain age group.
2. NYC police should focus on implementing policies to reduce unspecifird and driver inattention.
3. To avoid collision in NYC, signal should be placed in every turn and lane change.
4. Drivers should maintain a safe distance while driving.
